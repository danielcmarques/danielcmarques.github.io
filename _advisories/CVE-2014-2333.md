The affected versions of Lazyest Gallery are vulnerable to a Stored Cross Site Scripting. This vulnerability might allow remote authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript or HTML by manipulating the EXIF data of an image and uploading it to the gallery. This flaw exists because the plugin does not validate EXIF data before returning it to users.
