php-font-lib contains a flaw that allows a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the make_subset.php script does not validate input to the ‘name’ parameter before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user’s browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
