You have to build your organization’s Red Team from scratch. Where do you start? Organizations building internal red teams and penetration testing programs to keep up with the latest threats typically face three challenges: translating results to other security functions and leadership, aligning the red team program with business objectives, and demonstrating value.

This talk aims to help attendees address these challenges and kickstart their internal red team programs by:

* Outlining challenges, positive results, and setbacks identified while building internal red team programs;
* Proposing approaches to improving communication, integrating enterprise functions, and measuring program effectiveness
* Discussing our experiences managing a team of red team operators, helping organizations build a red team program, and what was observed in many companies trying to develop similar initiatives.

The goal is to help attendees kickstart an in-house red team program, providing ideas to communicate with other security functions, keep red team operators engaged, and deliver meaningful outcomes aligned with the overall cybersecurity goals. After the talk, attendees should be capable of taking the first steps toward deploying a team focused on improving the organization’s security posture instead of rinse-and-repeat testing.
