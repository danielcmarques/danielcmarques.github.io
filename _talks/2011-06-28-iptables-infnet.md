This tutorial focused on understanding and developing IPtables rules for large network environments. <i>Original title: "Descomplicando o IPtables."</i>  

By the end of the tutorial, participants were able to set up firewalls and routers using IPtables, including:
* Design network rules according to a business case.
* Apply chains and policies to restrict network access.
* Set up IPtables logs for monitoring.
