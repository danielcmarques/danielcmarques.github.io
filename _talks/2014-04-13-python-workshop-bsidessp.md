This workshop focused on developing custom tools and scripts to address challenges while performing a penetration test when there are no tools available to complete the work. <i>Original title: "Oficina Quick'n'Dirty Python para Penetration Testers"</i>.   

By the end of the workshop, participants were able to identify packages and resources to aid in writing python code and creating custom scripts to address day-to-day penetration testing activities, such as:

* Password attacks.
* Analyze metadata from files.
* Automate attacks against multiple targets.
