Organizations building internal red teams and penetration testing programs to keep up with the latest threats typically face three challenges: translating results to other security functions and leadership; aligning the red team program with business objectives; and demonstrating value. Learn how to address these challenges and kickstart your internal red team programs. We’ll explore approaches to improving communication, integrating enterprise functions and measuring program effectiveness. You’ll be ready to take the first steps toward deploying a team focused on improving your organization’s security posture in lieu of “rinse-and-repeat” testing.
