During a security conference in 2013, a presenter claimed that using the Kali Linux’s RockYou wordlist and the Hashcat’s best64 rule attackers could crack 50% of passwords. This research contributes to the discussion by demonstrating how regionalization impacts the user’s password choices. Notably, it points out how wordlists based on local dictionaries will affect password recovery efficiency.

This presentation provides a new view of password cracking research by:

* Exchange experiences through showing positive results, drawbacks, failures, and challenges while cracking passwords from .br domains.
* Testing the performance of some popular wordlists against different scenarios.
* Identifying patterns and behavior of users while choosing their passwords, beyond 'qwerty'.
* Providing tools, scripts, rules, and wordlists to aid in cracking Brazilian passwords but useful for any language.
