This tutorial focused on developing custom tools and scripts to automate security analysis tasks. <i>Original title: "Python para Análises de Segurança"</i>.   

By the end of the tutorial, participants were able to set up a Python development environment, identify packages and resources to aid in writing Python code, and create custom scripts to address day-to-day security-related activities, such as:
* Dissect and analyze package data.
* Utilize search engine API for reconnaissance.
* Automate collecting information from web sites.
