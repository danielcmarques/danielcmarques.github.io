I had the privilege of developing and teaching this Linux administration extension course at [Instituto Infnet](https://www.infnet.edu.br) from 2011 to 2014. This comprehensive course covered the essential aspects of Linux administration, including system architecture, package management, command-line usage, and filesystem concepts. My goal was to provide students with a hands-on learning experience that would not only equip them with a thorough understanding of Linux administration but also prepare them for real-world challenges in the field.

I personally developed all the courseware for this class.
