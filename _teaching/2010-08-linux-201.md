I developed and taught this follow up Fundamentals Linux Administration extension course at [Instituto Infnet](https://www.infnet.edu.br) from 2010 to 2014. During the extension course, participants explored various topics such as hardware configuration, boot processes, package management, disk partitioning, command-line usage, filesystem management, file permissions, and system file organization. The course included hands-on exercises and practical demonstrations. Students learned how to configure hardware settings, design disk layouts, manage software packages, manipulate files and directories, and understand the Linux filesystem hierarchy.

I personally developed all the courseware for this class.
