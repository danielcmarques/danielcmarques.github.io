Welcome! I am Daniel, a cybersecurity professional with a M.Sc. at the [University of San Diego Cybersecurity Operations and Leadership program](https://www.sandiego.edu/). As an experienced Red Team leader, I apply a strong background in software development and networking to help Fortune 500 companies identify and remediate vulnerabilities in various technologies, including corporate networks, applications, and smart devices. Working in the Cybersecurity field since 2006, major local security conferences featured [my penetration test research](https://danielcmarques.github.io/talks/). In 2019, I was part of the team that won the [DEF CON 27](https://www.defcon.org/) Biohacking Village Capture the Flag competition.
