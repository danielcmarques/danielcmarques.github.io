Welcome! I am Daniel, an MS candidate at the [University of San Diego Cybersecurity Operations and Leadership program](https://www.sandiego.edu/). I will keep this portfolio updated with my coursework, thoughts, papers, and talks throughout the program. I have been working in the cybersecurity field for over ten years, mostly with penetration testing. I was also part of the team that won the 2019 MedCTF during the [DEF CON 27](https://www.defcon.org/) security conference. You can learn more about my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcmarques/).
