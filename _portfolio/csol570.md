Many organizations have limited or no visibility of network traffic and assets in various network segments, directly impacting the organization's security posture. For instance, network visibility was a significant issue in the Equifax incident (United States Government Accountability Office, 2018); the company failed to identify critical vulnerabilities in high-value assets and could not detect malicious activity across the environment. Therefore, establishing an effective Network Visualization and Vulnerability Detection strategy is essential to support the "ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions" (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2011). 

At the same time, we face many ethical considerations when establishing an effective monitoring strategy, such as evaluating data moving through the network and intercepting sensitive information. As cybersecurity practitioners, it is our professional responsibility to balance out risk management and privacy.

## Building A Network Visualization and Vulnerability Detection Lab

A hands-on approach to cybersecurity learning can be very beneficial; for instance, Hess (2019) proposes that practical experiences are often more engaging and help students retain the content better.

The following paper describes a study laboratory to practice typical network visualization and vulnerability detection activities, including developing two trade studies to select appropriate tools, the virtualized lab architecture, the security toolkit leverage during the exercises, and exploitation actions performed with the lab.
