### [Windows Security Reference Monitor](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Reference_Monitor.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
 This paper briefly discusses the Windows Security Reference Monitor (SRM), Microsoft’s security policy implementation, by mapping parts of the Windows security system components to a model reference monitor and its ramifications towards information protection.

### [Research Lab Security Strategy and Design](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Final_Project.Research_Lab_Security_Strategy_and_Design.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
The final project scenario presents a large Information Technology company wishing to deploy a new research innovation lab. The facility will be onsite, and the lab will be available to employees and people outside of the company’s personnel. The lab must support collaboration through flexibility and scalability while securing the corporate environment from external threats. This work proposes a security framework based on NIST (2018) and the “zero trust” model to support the development and deployment of the lab by outlining cybersecurity risks to the project and providing strategy and architecture to mitigate threats to the preservation of availability, utility, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, and possession  (Parker, 2014) of the company’s information while addressing business requirements. The paper assumes that the lab will be located in a multi-floor building and share its physical and environmental controls (fire suppressants, heat and cooling systems, and access control mechanisms). It also considers a “bring your own device” (BYOD) model for the research lab and that researchers may not be in the same location. Finally, the paper does not make any financial considerations and focuses on high-level controls to separate the lab environment from the corporate environment.
