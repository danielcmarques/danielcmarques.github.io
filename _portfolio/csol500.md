A solid foundation is vital to lead cyber security functions effectively. Exploring essential cyber security concepts such as threats, the role of security policies, protection mechanisms and security assurance, privacy, and cyber security leadership, helps leaders understand how to enhance, support, and promote cyber security in organizations.

The selected coursework below demonstrate my approach to key cyber security concepts.

## Selected Coursework
Defining and enforcing policies is a fundamental part of cyber security as a function. Reference monitors are an excellent example of a mechanism used in operating systems to ensure security architecture integrity. Studying Microsoft’s implementation of reference monitors helps understand how the concepts of complete mediation, isolation, and verifiability are critical to enforcing access control policies.

Next, the final project illustrates the practical application of fundamental cyber security concepts. It demonstrates how cyber security leaders should establish policies and controls to mitigate risks associated with relevant threads while serving as business enablers.

### [Windows Security Reference Monitor](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Reference_Monitor.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
This paper briefly discusses the Windows Security Reference Monitor (SRM), Microsoft’s security policy implementation, by mapping parts of the Windows security system components to a model reference monitor and its ramifications towards information protection.

### [Research Lab Security Strategy and Design](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Final_Project.Research_Lab_Security_Strategy_and_Design.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
The final project challenged the students to design a strategy and architecture for a  large Information Technology company wishing to deploy an on-site new research innovation lab available to employees and third-party collaborators. This paper proposes a security framework based on the NIST recommendations and the “zero trust” model to support the development and deployment of the lab by outlining cybersecurity risks to the project and providing strategy and architecture to mitigate threats to the organization while addressing business requirements.

### Discussion: Looking to the future
Companies move to collect increasing amounts of user data, and our exposure to threats follows the same pace. Additionally, threats continue to adapt and evolve; for instance, Emm (2020) describes threats branching out from shared codebase to add functionality or customize features according to the targeted victim. With that in mind, cybersecurity threats tend to increase.

Many products based on machine learning and artificial intelligence in the cybersecurity industry focus on detection and minimal response. Soon, we will rely heavily on these technologies to detect and triage events, helping identify the information relevant to the team. Therefore, I believe the future of cybersecurity lies in the automation of “heavy lifting” tasks.

From a strategic point of view, I believe companies will have to continue adapting to new privacy laws. In that sense, cybersecurity professionals’ role will be to bridge the gap between technology, business, and compliance in a cost-effective and timely manner.

## Reflection
Cyber security is a multidomain discipline. As such, a solid understanding of its foundational concepts and how they relate is essential to establishing efficient and effective controls. As professionals, we build on top of this knowledge to advance the cyber security field.

The reference monitor coursework is excellent to demonstrate how these fundamental concepts apply to modern operating systems, as it highlights how policies must be enforced through a consistent validation mechanism. Another important aspect of reference monitors is their verifiability; cyber security controls are based on assumptions, and practitioners should verify their efficacy frequently to ensure they act as intent. As a Red Team manager, I constantly challenge these assumptions; therefore, understanding studying the Windows reference monitor was a good refresher of core security concepts related to security assurance.

Although our field has many areas of expertise, a leader might benefit significantly from a broad understanding of all security domains. That qualifies us to effectively approach all the moving parts of a security strategy, ensuring they support each other and serve as business enablers. The final project was vital to demonstrate this aspect of studying fundamentals; the design of a cyber security strategy for the research lab allowed us to understand business requirements, threats, and vulnerabilities to establish security controls that mitigate associated risks.

In a data-driven world like the one we live in, discussing ethics in our professional became increasingly relevant. Discussing the future of cyber security made me reflect on the many concerns associated with data privacy. As professionals, we are ethically bound to ensure that the data under our responsibility is safeguarded against relevant threats.

In summary, reviewing these foundational cyber security concepts is vital for the continued development of the cyber security field. Periodically going back to the basics will allow us to improve existing knowledge and effectively propose relevant cyber security strategies. As a cyber security manager, I apply these fundamentals daily to identify threats and recommend controls to mitigate associated risks.
