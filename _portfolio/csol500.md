This course explored essential cyber security concepts, such as threats, the role of security policies, protection mechanisms and security assurance, privacy, and cyber security leadership. The course’s primary goal was to establish a foundational understanding of how leaders can enhance, support, and promote cyber security in organizations.

## Selected Course Work
Work In progress.

### [Windows Security Reference Monitor](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Reference_Monitor.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
 This paper briefly discusses the Windows Security Reference Monitor (SRM), Microsoft’s security policy implementation, by mapping parts of the Windows security system components to a model reference monitor and its ramifications towards information protection.

### [Research Lab Security Strategy and Design](http://danielcmarques.github.io/files/coursework/csol500/Assignment.CSOL500.Final_Project.Research_Lab_Security_Strategy_and_Design.Daniel_Cordeiro_Marques.pdf)
The final project scenario challenged the students to design a strategy and architecture for a  large Information Technology company wishing to deploy an on-site new research innovation lab available to employees and third-party collaborators. This paper proposes a security framework based on the NIST recommendations and the “zero trust” model to support the development and deployment of the lab by outlining cybersecurity risks to the project and providing strategy and architecture to mitigate threats to the organization while addressing business requirements.

### Discussion: Looking to the future
Companies move to collect increasing amounts of user data, and our exposure to threats follows the same pace. Additionally, threats continue to adapt and evolve; for instance, Emm (2020) describes threats branching out from shared codebase to add functionality or customize features according to the targeted victim. With that in mind, cybersecurity threats tend to increase.

Many products based on machine learning and artificial intelligence in the cybersecurity industry focus on detection and minimal response. Soon, we will rely heavily on these technologies to detect and triage events, helping identify the information relevant to the team. Therefore, I believe the future of cybersecurity lies in the automation of “heavy lifting” tasks.

From a strategic point of view, I believe companies will have to continue adapting to new privacy laws. In that sense, cybersecurity professionals’ role will be to bridge the gap between technology, business, and compliance in a cost-effective and timely manner.
