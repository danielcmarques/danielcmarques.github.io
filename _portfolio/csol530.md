As the number of cybersecurity incidents continues to rise, companies a structured approach to enterprise risk management and a cyber risk management framework aligned with the overall its strategy. The NIST cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) offers a methodology to select controls to protect essential security properties based on the company’s strategy, threats, vulnerabilities, and compliance requirements.

## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST RMF offers a well-defined and structured approach to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets based on business requirements and objectives. It addresses security in critical areas of the risk management process: identification of assets, selection of controls according to the business requirements, test of controls, and monitoring. Companies can prepare to manage their risks, select, and implement appropriate controls, assess their efficacy, ensure accountability, and continuously monitor their risk exposure through its seven steps (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2018, p. 8):

* **Step 1 - Prepare.** During this step, the company prepares itself to manage risk by identifying roles and responsibilities (and the people carrying them), its mission, business processes, and the organizational strategy.
* **Step 2 - Categorize.** After collecting organizational and business process information, assets are categorized according to the damage to their confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* **Step 3 - Select.** This step selects, tailors, and documents control baselines to minimize each asset’s risk according to their category.
* **Step 4 - Implement.** This step aims to implement controls selected while updating the baseline according to information obtained during their implementation.
* **Step 5 - Assess.** Following the implementation of controls, this step is responsible for verifying if they were implemented correctly, operate as intended, and produce the desired outcome in safeguarding the asset’s security properties.  
* **Step 6 - Authorize.** This step aims to ensure accountability by requesting that senior management recognize that the current security state is an acceptable risk level.  
* **Step 7 - Monitor.** Following the authorization step, the company must continuously monitor the security posture. If the risk outlook changes, the output from this step can trigger updates in the controls to achieve an adequate risk level.

NIST provides extensive documentation and implementation guidance on the [Risk Management Framework website](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf). Particularly, the [RMF for Systems and Organizations Introductory Course](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/rmf-course) offers an introduction to risk management and an overview of the framework.

## Applied Cyber Risk Management Exercise
The following paper offers an overview of the RMF as applied to a payroll system case study, summarizing and exemplifying each step’s outputs. It also provides a continuous monitoring strategy for the payroll system based on pre-existing policies, procedures, and software.
