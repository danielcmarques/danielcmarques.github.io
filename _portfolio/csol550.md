## Audit & Compliance
Security assessments are essential to maintain a robust security strategy. They provide feedback on the efficacy and efficiency of the implemented controls in mitigating risks to the business. Furthermore, internal audits are essential to ensure adequate adherence to policies and that controls are compliant with rules and regulations (Touhill & Touhill, 2014, p. 66).

Organizations typically employ evidence-based audits to evaluate the performance of the security initiatives following a formal process based on a methodology centered on the business risks. Audits, however, frequently fail to demonstrate the impact of a security gap tangibly. As such, organizations may employ Ethical Hackers to emulate real threats chaining vulnerabilities and assess the effect of the simulated breach on the business objectives.

The following paper describes both methods and their expected outcomes, concluding with their applicability to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture.

## The Economics of Cyber - Balancing Risk With Cyber Impact Calculations
Budgeting continues to be a challenge for cybersecurity professionals; a rapidly changing technological environment, the organization’s business agenda, and appetite for cost reduction can all affect the allocation of cybersecurity investments (Bernard & Nicholson, 2020).

It is critical that, when budgeting for cybersecurity, practitioners adequately demonstrate the positive impact of the investments in the business. Specifically, Schneier (2008) argues that “a company should implement only security countermeasures that affect its bottom line positively.”; traditionally, the cybersecurity executives demonstrate that impact using the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), which considers the number of incidents per year and the potential loss per incident (Kolochenko, 2015). For instance, consider the Marriot incident in 2020, with 5.2 million records compromised (Mihalcik, 2020). The Ponemon Institute (2020) observed that the average cost of a breach of this magnitude is USD 50 million. As the event occurred for the second time between 2018 and 2020, one could consider the 0.5 as the number of incidents per year, resulting in an ALE of USD 25 Million (less than 1% of Marriot’s revenue in 2020).

The advantage of this method is the use of factual data (although not necessarily based on a benchmark of industry peers) to establish how much to invest in cybersecurity. However, this calculation presents two issues: it might not consider the individual systems, people, and processes and how an attacker might leverage them to amplify losses and potential over or underestimate the number of incidents per year.

When looking into incidents, obtaining the number of materialized incidents is essential to calculate a reasonable ALE. A high number of false positives results in a higher ALE, which might impact the senior leadership view towards the cost of security. Similarly, Schneier (2008) noted that rare and expensive events could be tough to evaluate. Besides the potential necessity to guess its frequency, the residual cost can overflow through years to come.

Finally, balancing risk and cost should consider both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The CISO should understand how cybersecurity investments help the organization achieve its goals and the direct impact on the bottom line.

## People and Organizations
### IT Staffing Models and Their Cybersecurity Risks
Generally, organizations do not see Information Technology (IT) as part of their core business, although they recognize its importance in maintaining a competitive edge. Deloitte (2020) reflects that trend by outlining cost, flexibility, and speed to market are the primary drivers for outsourcing. However, IT staff outsourcing comes with many cybersecurity risks, including exposure of sensitive information to third parties, impact on business continuity, and potential compliance concerns.

Organizations may choose between many IT staffing models, from an in-house team to a fully outsourced group. Considering the increasing challenge of hiring and retaining top IT talent, outsourcing appears to be a reasonable option to reduce cost and improve flexibility for many businesses; however, leveraging a service provider might expose the organization to cybersecurity risks. Executives must consider third-party access to sensitive information, limitations to enforce accountability, business continuity, and impact on the organization’s compliance efforts before moving forward. These risks can be identified and mitigated early in the acquisition process and during the service delivery by performing robust third-party risk management, ensuring the contract document requirements, and constantly evaluating the vendor to ensure compliance with the organization’s cybersecurity objectives.

## Cybersecurity Staffing Model
Building a team cybersecurity team is challenging due to the requirement of a multidisciplinary group that understands the organization’s business and a growing workforce gap. Therefore, to efficiently manage efforts to recruit, the executive leadership must understand what to expect from cybersecurity roles and staff them accordingly.

Although there is a growing shortage of experienced cybersecurity professionals, organizations can use common competencies and certifications to establish a baseline requirement to support broader cybersecurity functions. Within these functions, team members can rotate between roles to provide exposure to different responsibilities, potentially protecting the organization from resource availability risks associated with turnover

The following paper outlines functions, competencies, and certifications organizations can use to train and develop internal talent. Following this path comes with the advantage of leveraging someone with organizational knowledge and understanding of the business, which can become an asset when providing cybersecurity solutions aligned with the organization's goals.
