Modern organizations coexist in a fast-paced and competitive environment, making cybersecurity a significant concern that involves many aspects, such as alignment with business goals and regulatory compliance. For instance, Budgeting continues to be a challenge for cybersecurity professionals; a rapidly changing technological environment, the organization’s business agenda, and appetite for cost reduction can all affect the allocation of cybersecurity investments (Bernard & Nicholson, 2020).

Driving the execution of a robust cyber security strategy with all its moving parts requires careful and structured planning. The Information Systems Security Plan (ISSP) allows organizations to turn their vision into reality by documenting security requirements and associated controls, roles, and expected responsibilities of involved parties. Furthermore, as the ISSP “delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system” (Swanson et al., 2006), the plan serves as an enabler to fulfill their ethical and professional responsibilities.


## Sample Information Systems Security Plan (ISSP)
The following paper illustrates an ISSP for a software engineering company helping clients with personal budgeting and financial education through a cloud-based platform. This sample ISSP specifies security requirements and associated controls to safeguard the platform.

## Reflection
As cybersecurity continues to be a concern for most organizations, executives face the challenge of balancing between reducing risks and the ethical considerations of their decisions while supporting the organization’s compliance efforts.

The modern security executive is professionally responsible for creating a culture of cybersecurity within the organization based on business needs. The executive must ensure the organization safeguards its people, processes, and technologies against the latest threats, but keeping in mind that the controls should enable business and maintain its competitive advantage (Touhill & Touhil, 2014, p. 3). Furthermore, the executive is responsible for ensuring the organization complies with the relevant laws and standards from a legal perspective. Fail to comply with these regulations might severely impact the organization’s reputation and operations, ultimately leading to fines.

We can look at the executive’s ethical responsibilities from the stakeholder angle: for instance, as Krishnan (2019) and Fruhlinger (2021) points out, the organization must protect its high-value assets without crossing the line of employee privacy; the clients, on the other hand, want to understand how the organization protects their information, and their use according to the business needs. In that case, the executive’s role is to ensure consistent organization alignment with the terms agreed with all parties.

Therefore, the modern security executives must look beyond technological and compliance aspects; they must analyze the organization as a whole, communicating and addressing complex problems according to its needs.
