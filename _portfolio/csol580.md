Cyberattacks continue to increase, and organization cannot defend themselves against everything. However, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) allows organizations to acquire intelligence from different sources to understand how adversaries operate and focus our efforts on what matters. Effective CTI must consider the context. For instance, if adversaries exploit a critical vulnerability in the wild and our mission-critical systems run the affected software, cybersecurity leaders will naturally want to focus their efforts on addressing the issue. Cyber security professionals should also consider intelligence collection's legal and ethical implications; any CTI function should gather information lawfully and avoid violating corporate responsibility practices to prevent exposing the organization to legal action or damages to its image.


## Cyber Threat Intelligence Plan (CTIP)

For the final project, we were tasked to develop a summary plan based on CTI. This CTI plan enumerates threats against USD and outlines controls that effectively mitigate risks associated with the University's operations. The plan also highlights lessons learned from past incidents associated with similar threats to draw recommendations to improve USD's cyber security posture. It proposes seven initiatives that should be performed in the next three to eighteen months, focused on preventing threats in the early stages of the attack, detecting their activities during the event, and minimizing the impact upon successful compromise.

## Reflection

As cyber security practitioners, it is our professional responsibility to select and implement controls that effectively and efficiently mitigate risks to our organization. Establishing a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program is vital to understanding how threats operate and tailoring defenses accordingly, providing a competitive advantage over adversaries.

While studying the definition of intelligence and comparing the approach of many different organizations, the course highlighted the importance of context to produce and consume intelligence products. For instance, various government agencies might focus on distinct sources and objectives to collect and process information to transform it into actionable intelligence. In my current role as a Red Team leader, obtaining this knowledge was critical to interpreting work generated by multiple intelligence sources.

However, collecting and processing data to create actionable intelligence may provoke ethical and professional concerns. _Is It Ethical to Gather Competitive Intelligence?_ (2020) recommends leveraging only public sources of information; the Department of Justice’s Cybersecurity Unit (2020) describes legal considerations in gathering CTI data online, providing rules and recommendations to help practitioners lawfully collect intelligence from multiple sources. In essence, organizations should:

* Avoid unlawful collection of data, such as intercepting communications without consent.
* Refrain from actively trying to penetrate systems to gain access to information.
* Avoid impersonating people without their permission.       

In addition to DOJ recommendations, it is our ethical and professional obligation ensure that organizations follow their code of ethics and corporate responsibility guidelines while performing adversarial assessment and intelligence gathering activities, leaning on their legal counsel to minimize the chances of litigation (Singh & Vij, 2012).
